[React App.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4605b5e6-1b19-42a3-9fcb-5b4ef95576e9)

👉 I would collaborate with my teammate in the following ways: 
- discussing/planning the required improvements and set ourselves goals
- splitting up the tasks between us based on the workload
- reviewing each other’s code to ensure our code quality, catch any bugs, suggest optimizations
- tracking each other’s progress using any kanban board tool 
- pair program together to test

🤔 If you had more time, what you’d improve or explore further?

👉 If I had time to improve or explore further, I want to do the following:

- persist data using a database
- add authentication to track who adds superheroes
- document all APIs using swagger
- cover all endpoints with tests
